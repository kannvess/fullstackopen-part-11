# Heads up
For this discussion, I'll pick Java as the programming language.

# First question
- Based on what I've read on reddit and javatpoint, Checkstyle is the most popular linter for Java among developers.
- Next, for testing Java programs, you can use JUnit. It is actually recommended by mooc.fi in Part 6 of their Java Programming course.
- Third, Java build tools. I've heard some build tools such as Maven, Gradle, and Ant, but the one that sticks out the most is Gradle since it is used in React Native for building Android apps.

# Second question
- CircleCI
- Bamboo
- Travis CI. I've actually heard about this one but not very familiar with it.
- Azure Pipelines. I'm planning to use Azure for cloud computing, I may encounter this later.
- AWS CodePipeline

# Third question
The hypothetical application being worked on is an Inventory Management System. I have been planning to develop one using JavaScript and based on my research and countless amount of brainstorming, a cloud-based environment would be better since the application itself doesn't really need an extensive amount of resource and special needs. For this specific case, I would use Checkstyle for linting the code, and then use JUnit for writing tests. Next, I would use Gradle for building the code and use Github Actions for the CI/CD part.
